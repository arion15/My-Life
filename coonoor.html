                     over 1,000 plant species. The botanical garden is partly developed 
                     in the Japanese style and derived its name from J. D. Sim, the secretary o
                     f the Madras Club in 1874. The key attraction of the park is the annual fruit and 
                     vegetable show held in May.[4][5] Dolphin's Nose Viewpoint is 10 km from Coonoor and prov
