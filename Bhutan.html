                    Stone tools, weapons, elephants, and remnants of l
                    arge stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan wa
                    s inhabited as early as 2000 BC, although there are no exist
                    ing records from that time. Historians have theorised that the state 
                    of Lhomon (literally, "southern darkness"), or Monyul 
                    ("Dark Land", a reference to the Monpa, an ethnic group in Bhutan and 
                    Arunachal Pradesh, India) m
                    ay have existed between 500 BC and AD 600.
