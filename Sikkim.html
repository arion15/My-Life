                <p>Sikkim  is a state in Northeastern India.
                     It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China in the north and northeast,
                      Bhutan in the east, Province No. 1 of Nepal in the west and West Bengal in the south.
                       Sikkim is also close to the Siliguri Corridor, which borders Bangladesh.
                     Sikkim is the least populous and second smallest among the Indian states.

                    he Lepchas are considered to be the earliest inhabitants of Sikkim.
                     However the Limbus and the Magars also lived in the inaccessible 
                     parts of West and South districts as early as the Lepchas perhaps 
                     lived in the East and North districts.[25] The Buddhist saint Padmasambhava
                     , also known as Guru Rinpoche, is said to have passed through the land in the 
                     8th century.The Guru is reported to have blessed the land, introduced Buddhism, 
                    and foretold the era of monarchy that would arrive in Sikkim centuries later.

                    Situated in the Himalayan mountains,
                     the state of Sikkim is characterised by mountainous terrain.
                     Almost the entire state is hilly,
                      with an elevation ranging from 280 metres (920
                       ft) in the south at the border with West Bengal
                        to 8,586 metres (28,169 ft) in northern peaks 
                        near Nepal and Tibet. The summit of Kangchenjunga,
                         the world's third-highest peak, is the state's highest point,
                     situated on the border between Sikkim and Nepal.
