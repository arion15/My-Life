                <p>Nepal , officially
                     The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal , is a landlocked country in South Asia.
                      It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain,
                       bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India in the south, east,
                        and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh
                     by the Siliguri Corridor, and fr
                     om Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim.

                    By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived
                     on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had 
                     earlier evolved.[26][27][28] The earliest known modern
                      human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
                       ago.[29] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence
                        of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.
                     After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops 
                     and animals, construction of permanent structures, and 
                     storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and 
                     other sites in what is now BalochistanThese gradually 
                     developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[32][31] 
                     the first urban culture in South Asia.[33] Prehistoric 
                     sites of palaeolithic, 
                     mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in 
                     the Siwalik hills of Dang district.

                    Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, ab
                    out 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 
                    kilometres (120 mi) wide, with an area of
                     147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies betw
                     een latitudes 26째 and 31째N, and longitude
                     s 80째 and 89째E. Nepal's defining geologic
                     al processes began 75 million years ago w
                     hen the Indian plate, then part of the so
                     uthern supercontinent Gondwana, began a no
                     rth-eastward drift caused by seafloor spre
                     ading to its south-west, and later, south a
                     nd south-east.[73] Simultaneously, the vast
                      Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, be
                      gan to subduct under the Eurasian plate.
                      These dual processes, driven by convection
                       in the Earth's mantle, both created the I
                       ndian Ocean and caused the Indian continen
                       tal crust eventually to under-thrust Euras
                       ia andto uplift the Himalayas
